Hello! My name is @DeeraWj and you can reach me at deerawj@gmail.com. I am currently learning Python and Rust and am always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset in the field of programming. In my free time, I am also working on developing my own website, deerawj.com, which is still under construction. If you have a project in mind or are looking for someone to collaborate with on anything open source, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am excited to take on new challenges and grow as a programmer. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me!
